  <div class="content"><p>I feel very excited and can recommend Zhang Xinyue as a recommender for elective xx. I am currently working as a senior algorithm engineer in the map division of Didi Travel. Didi Chuxing is the world's largest one-stop travel platform, with tens of millions of users using our services every day. My job is to use machine learning, deep learning and other technologies, combined with massive travel big data, to provide users with services such as route planning and arrival time estimation. Xinyue joined our team as a product intern since December last year. In the following four months, she participated in a number of projects. The outstanding performance of Xinyue left a deep impression on the members of our team, and we agreed that she is one of our best interns.</p>

<p>First of all, Xinyue is very smart and has deep data analysis capabilities. One of our most important businesses is to estimate the price of online car-hailing orders before the start of the trip. Xinyue uses SQL to aggregate and analyze order data from multiple dimensions such as mileage, time, and weather, compare the estimated performance in different periods, and find the defect scenarios of our previous model. The in-depth model after the current iteration has been successfully applied to more than 20 million online car-hailing orders every day, effectively reducing the experience damage caused by the inaccurate price estimate.</p>

<p>Secondly, Xinyue also has good communication skills. During her work, she organized multiple meetings with colleagues including product, engineering, strategy, and testing. Before each meeting, the problem can be analyzed in depth. In the meeting, I am confident to share my thoughts with us and have a heated discussion with us. In addition, as a product intern, every time she writes a requirement document, she can be logically clear, complete in content, and properly worded. Received unanimous praise from the project partners.</p>

<p>From a personal point of view, Xinyue is a very disciplined, hardworking and cheerful person. She can not only complete the tasks we arranged, but also take the initiative to share the pressure of other colleagues. In her spare time, she can actively learn R language-related analysis tools, and can share and analyze her learning process on the Internet. Finally, she participated in public welfare projects to answer questions about how high school graduates choose college majors and how to make career plans.</p>

<p>During this internship experience, Xinyue showed her sensitivity to data, her curiosity for unknown things, and her ability to quickly understand technology. I think she is one of the best candidates for your major. There is no doubt that she will apply these abilities in subsequent studies. I hope you can allow her to study this major in the next year.</p>
